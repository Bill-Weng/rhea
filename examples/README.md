
# Examples
This directory contains examples for certain FPGA development
boards and conversion examples.  The FPGA examples build a system 
with the `mn` cores and execute the FPGA toolflow.  

Most of the conversion examples are *core builders*, 
the conversion scipts will accept a handful of command-line arguments
that determine configuration of the converted core.  These can 
be used to create Verilog of VHDL version of the cores.
